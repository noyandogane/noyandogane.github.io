## Suggested New Projects

- **Chaotic Pendulum Playground** – simulate a double or triple pendulum with draggable starting positions and rainbow trails that highlight chaotic motion.
- **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** – animate bubble, insertion, merge, and quick sort side by side with adjustable array sizes and speeds.
- **Epidemic Spread Simulator** – show individuals moving on a grid with sliders for infection probability, recovery time, and distancing measures.
- **Perlin Noise Terrain Generator** – render scrolling 2D terrain using Perlin noise with seed, frequency, and elevation controls.
- **Game of Life Sandbox** – provide Conway’s Game of Life with preset patterns, paint tools, and step/run simulation modes.
- **Fourier Series Drawer** – visualize rotating epicycles that reconstruct drawn shapes, allowing users to sketch their own paths.
- **Traffic Intersection Simulator** – animate cars and pedestrians navigating an intersection where users can tweak light timing and lane count.
- **Fractal Tree Builder** – render recursive trees with controls for branch angle, depth, and seasonal color palettes.
- **Shortest Path Explorer** – let users place start/end nodes and walls on a grid, then step through Dijkstra or A* in real time.
- **Turbulent Fluid Visualizer** – interact with a simplified 2D fluid simulation, injecting dye or velocity to watch swirling patterns evolve.
